        <p>Took a few days off to go to my home town of Grande Cache. It was so nice to see some friends.
            I didnt realize how much this pandemic affected me not socializing. Having no friends in Leduc is tough so im glad
            i decided to go.
        </p>
        <p>I started yoga about a week ago and Ive really noticed a difference in myself. Taking a moment
            to just focus on breathing is something i really needed with how much stress and anxiety im feeling these days.
